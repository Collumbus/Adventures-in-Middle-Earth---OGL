# Adventures-in-Middle-Earth --- OGL

This is a fork of [@NotRussellCrowe](https://svn.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?37167-Adventures-in-Middle-Earth&highlight=Adventures+in+Middle-Earth)'s version 0.4. This extension modifies the player character sheet. It adds boxes for Corruption and Shadow and the Madness and Miserable conditions. It also adds the new skills of Lore, Riddles, Traditions, and Shadow Lore.

- The packaged files are in the `compressedFiles` folder.
